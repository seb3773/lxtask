LXTask - lightweight and desktop-independent task manager derived from xfce4-taskmanager with all dependencies on xfce removed,
new features,and some improvement of the user interface.

## This fork has the following modifications:

-Added swap usage/total gauge
-Added CPU Speed in existing CPU gauge
-Differents colors for each gauge
-Button 'Quit' replaced by a 'End task button' (we can close the windows with esc or the close button on the titlebar, I don't
 think I need a third quit button :p ) and it's more like win taskmgr end task button :)
-Replaced the priorities numbers by more comprehensible terms
-some interface color modifications
-some terms changed
-systray icon with cpu load indicator 'ala windows'
-systray menu with 'keep above' and quit   ;)


Notes for compilation: it requires intltool and GTK+ 2.6 or newer.
